# Simple-8-bit-CPU

This is a project based on Logisim. It shows the circuit layout of this CPU.
If you don't have Logisim, you can download the file "logisim-win-2.7.1.rar".

The main circuit design is in "8-bit CPU.circ".
To open this file, you must also have "ClockDemo.circ" and "ALU.circ" in the same path.
These two files include clk and ALU components that are used in the CPU.
